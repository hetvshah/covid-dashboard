Not responsive yet, works best on a desktop.

### Data

New York Times keeps an ongoing repo on coronavirus cases and deaths in the nation. Check out their [repo](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

*Note:* The dropdown on the Locations tab of the site only displays the first 500 counties since react-select slows down significantly with a large amount of entries. All counties are still **searchable** though.
